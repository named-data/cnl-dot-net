CNL.NET: An NDN Common Name Library for .NET
============================================

The Common Name Library (CNL) is a proposed API for NDN applications. Built on
top of the lower-level Interest/Data exchange primitives of the Common Client
Libraries, the CNL maintains an abstraction of the application's namespace. The
application can attach specialized handlers to nodes of the namespace, for
example to treat part of the name tree as segmented content, or to do data
encryption/decryption. The CNL can also alert the application when new names are
added to the namespace or when content is attached to a namespace node, whether
by receiving a Data packet from the network, retrieving from a repo, or
assembling the result of segmented content.

This library provides a .NET assembly and sample code in C#.
